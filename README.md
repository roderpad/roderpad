My name is Paden and I'm an applied physicist, software engineer, nanotech engineer, and process development engineer. I'm currently working as a data scientist / machine learning / AI engineer for Intel Corporation with a focus on creating ML utilities to leverage factory data to identify yield-impacting process issues and drive process development. At the end of the day, I really just enjoy tackling challenging problems with others who share my passion; be it hardware, software, or theory. I'm originally from Iowa (Go Hawks!), currently living in Palo Alto. You can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or occasionally on Twitch.
